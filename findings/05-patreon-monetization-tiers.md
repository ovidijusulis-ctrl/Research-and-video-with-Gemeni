Research the best Patreon tier structure and monetization strategy for an English learning podcast targeting global ESL learners.

Context: "Ovi English School" — daily English learning podcast using real news. Audience: mainly Asian ESL learners (Japan, Korea, Vietnam, Brazil). Already on Patreon at https://www.patreon.com/c/OviEnglishSchool but no tiers set up.

Research:

1. SUCCESSFUL ESL PATREON MODELS
   - Analyze tier structures of: English with Lucy, Rachel's English, Papa Teach Me, mmmEnglish
   - What do successful language teachers offer at each tier?
   - What price points work for global ESL audience?
   - What's the average conversion rate (free listener → paid subscriber)?

2. TIER STRUCTURE RECOMMENDATIONS
   - Free tier: What should stay free to keep growing?
   - $3-5/month tier: What's the "impulse buy" tier content?
   - $10-15/month tier: What premium content justifies this price?
   - $25+/month tier: Is there a high-tier for serious learners?

3. CONTENT IDEAS FOR EACH TIER
   - PDF study guides (already generating these)
   - Bonus episodes / extended episodes
   - Vocabulary lists / flashcards (Anki decks?)
   - Live Q&A sessions
   - Writing correction service
   - Pronunciation feedback
   - Community Discord/group

4. PRICING FOR DEVELOPING COUNTRIES
   - Purchasing power parity considerations
   - Should I offer different pricing for different regions?
   - How do other creators handle this?
   - Patreon's regional pricing features

5. REVENUE PROJECTIONS
   - Realistic subscriber conversion rates for podcast → Patreon
   - Average revenue per subscriber for education content
   - How long to reach $1000/month? $5000/month?
   - Best practices for promoting Patreon on free episodes

Give me a specific recommended tier structure with pricing, content for each tier, and launch strategy.
