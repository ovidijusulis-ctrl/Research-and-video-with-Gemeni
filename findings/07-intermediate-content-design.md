Research how to design effective B1-B2 (intermediate) English learning content for a podcast format, following CEFR standards.

Context: "Ovi English School" currently produces only beginner (A1-A2) episodes using simplified news. I want to add an intermediate tier that properly targets B1-B2 learners.

Research:

1. CEFR B1-B2 SPECIFICATIONS
   - What grammar structures should B1 vs B2 learners know?
   - Vocabulary range expectations (how many words?)
   - Speaking/listening comprehension levels
   - What distinguishes B1 from B2 specifically?

2. CONTENT ADAPTATION
   - How should intermediate news scripts differ from beginner?
   - Should I use more complex sentence structures? How much more?
   - Vocabulary selection — what word frequency range?
   - Should intermediate episodes be longer? How much?
   - Topics that work best for intermediate learners

3. DIALOGUE DESIGN FOR B1-B2
   - How should the Teacher-Student dynamic change?
   - Should the "student" character make fewer mistakes?
   - More complex discussion topics
   - Debate/opinion format vs Q&A format
   - Incorporating idioms and phrasal verbs naturally

4. ASSESSMENT AND PROGRESS
   - How to help listeners self-assess their level
   - What exercises work for intermediate listeners?
   - Comprehension questions at B1-B2 level
   - How to encourage listeners to "level up"

5. SUCCESSFUL INTERMEDIATE PODCASTS
   - What do BBC 6 Minute English, TED Talks Daily, etc. do well?
   - What topics engage intermediate learners specifically?
   - How do they balance teaching vs entertainment?

Give me specific LLM prompt templates for generating B1-B2 content from news stories.
