## Context

Ovi English School is an automated daily English learning podcast that generates episodes from real news. We currently publish to YouTube and RSS. We have:
- Zero budget for paid ads or marketing
- Zero existing audience (starting from scratch)
- A pipeline that already generates: episode script, vocabulary, questions, audio, video, PDF study guide
- Plans to add an interactive study website (see research file #10)

The user's stated goal: "We need to reach a level of the product to be useable. Then plan how to market, also gathering feedback would be a big priority."

We need a realistic, FREE growth strategy. No "spend $500 on Facebook ads" advice.

I'm launching an automated English learning podcast called "Ovi English School" that publishes daily episodes made from real news. Each episode teaches 5 vocabulary words, has comprehension questions, and cultural explanations. Target audience: A1-A2 (beginner) English learners worldwide.

I have ZERO marketing budget and ZERO existing audience. I need a realistic free growth strategy.

I need deep research on:
