Research how to automate podcast distribution to Apple Podcasts in 2026.

Context: I run "Ovi English School" — a daily English learning podcast. Already on YouTube and Spotify. Want to expand to Apple Podcasts with full automation.

Research:

1. APPLE PODCASTS CONNECT
   - How does the submission process work?
   - Is there an API for managing episodes?
   - Apple Podcasts Connect portal — what can be automated?

2. RSS-BASED APPROACH
   - Does Apple auto-ingest from RSS like Spotify?
   - RSS feed requirements specific to Apple Podcasts
   - Required tags and metadata (itunes:category, itunes:explicit, etc.)
   - How long does Apple take to pick up new episodes from RSS?

3. PODCAST HOSTING INTEGRATION
   - Do hosting platforms (Podbean, Buzzsprout) handle Apple distribution automatically?
   - One-click distribution vs manual submission
   - Cross-platform distribution services

4. APPLE PODCASTS OPTIMIZATION
   - Category selection for language learning
   - Keywords and SEO for Apple Podcasts search
   - Artwork requirements and best practices
   - How to get featured in "New & Noteworthy"

5. ANALYTICS
   - Apple Podcasts Analytics API — does it exist?
   - What listener data can I get from Apple?
   - How to track downloads and subscriber growth

Practical steps to get listed and stay automated.
